# Payetools
## Cross-platform Open-Source Library for UK payroll

**Payetools is the first library of its kind to bring open-source capabilities to UK payroll processing via a robust, cross-platform framework written in C#.**

Payetools contains support for calculating the following:

- UK Income Tax (all jurisdictions)
- National Insurance
- Student Loans
- Pensions using Qualifying Earnings and Pensionable Pay earnings bases (under both Relief at Source and Net Pay Arrangemnet tax treatments)
- Compliance with National Minimum/Living Wage regulations

The code passes HMRC tests for income tax, National Insurance, student loans and National Minimum Wage.

Tests are included for 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 tax year rates and thresholds.
