# Paytools.Core
## .NET Library for UK payroll

--- **Preliminary Release** (April 2023) ---

This is the first public release of Paytools.Core; it contains support for calculating the following:

- UK Income Tax (all jurisdictions)
- National Insurance
- Student Loans
- Pensions using Qualifying Earnings and Pensionable Pay earnings bases (under both Relief at Source and Net Pay Arrangemnet tax treatments)
- Compliance with National Minimum/Living Wage regulations

It is a work in progress.  The code passes HMRC tests for income tax, National Insurance, student loans and National Minimum Wage.

Tests are included for 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 tax year rates and thresholds.

### Documentation
Limited API documentation is available at https://paytools.dev.  This is a work in progress.
 
### Releases
The plan is to build and release the Paytools.Core libraries on a regular basis and to publish all supported modules via Nuget.  The first such publication is planned for May 2023.

### Roadmap
Support for running a complete set of payroll calculations is planned for release in Q2 2023.
