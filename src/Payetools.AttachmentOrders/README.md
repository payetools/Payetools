## Introduction


Although somewhat outdated, the HMCS document [Attachment Orders: A Guide for Employers](https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/pdf/aoehandbook-eng.pdf) provides a good overview of the process. Eastbourne Borough Council also has a useful [Attachment of Earnings - Employers Guide](https://www.lewes-eastbourne.gov.uk/media/4064/Attachment-of-earnings-employers-guide/pdf/Attachment_of_Earnings_-Employer_Guide_1.pdf).

The term Attachment Order used here is a generic term for all types of deductions from earnings communicated externally to employers and mandated by law, regardless of source or type.  There are in fact distinct types of deductions that can be made from an employee's earnings:
- Direct Earnings Attachment (DEA) - for tax debts
- Attachment of Earnings Order (AOE) - for court debts
- Child Maintenance Deduction from Earnings Order (CMEO) - for child maintenance debts
- Deduction from Earnings Order (DEO) - for benefit overpayments
- Deduction from Earnings Request (DER) - for benefit overpayments
- 

### Direct Earnings Attachment (DEA)
The Welfare Reform Act 2012, which became law in March 2012, allows DWP to instruct an employer to make deductions directly from a employee’s earnings, and it does this by instructing the employer to operate a Direct Earnings Attachment (DEA). DWP does not have to go through the civil courts to do this, unlike for example the Attachment of Earnings Order (AOE) process. Within the Welfare Reform Act, the legislation covering DEAs, part of the Social Security (Overpayment and Recovery) Regulations 2013, came into force on 8th April 2013. Note that these regulations are only in force in England, Scotland and Wales and so excludes Northern Ireland (and Channel Islands and the Isle of Man).
