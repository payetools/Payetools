## Introduction

This library provides calculations of Attachment Orders.  The term Attachment Order as used here is a generic term for all types of deductions from earnings mandated by law (often by the courts) and communicated externally to employers, regardless of source or type.  There are many distinct types of deductions that can be made from an employee's earnings; these are listed further below.

The legislation around Attachment Orders is complex and varies by jurisdiction. Although somewhat outdated, the HMCS document [Attachment Orders: A Guide for Employers](https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/pdf/aoehandbook-eng.pdf) provides a good overview of the process. Lewes and Eastbourne Councils also have a useful [Attachment of Earnings - Employers Guide](https://www.lewes-eastbourne.gov.uk/media/4064/Attachment-of-earnings-employers-guide/pdf/Attachment_of_Earnings_-Employer_Guide_1.pdf).

The term Attachment Order used here is a generic term for all types of deductions from earnings communicated externally to employers and mandated by law, regardless of source or type.  There are in fact distinct types of deductions that can be made from an employee's earnings:
- Direct Earnings Attachment (DEA) - for tax debts
- Attachment of Earnings Order (AOE) - for court debts
- Child Maintenance Deduction from Earnings Order (CMEO) - for child maintenance debts
- Deduction from Earnings Order (DEO) - for benefit overpayments
- Deduction from Earnings Request (DER) - for benefit overpayments
- 

### Direct Earnings Attachment (DEA)
The Welfare Reform Act 2012, which became law in March 2012, allows DWP to instruct an employer to make deductions directly from a employee’s earnings, and it does this by instructing the employer to operate a Direct Earnings Attachment (DEA). DWP does not have to go through the civil courts to do this, unlike for example the Attachment of Earnings Order (AOE) process. Within the Welfare Reform Act, the legislation covering DEAs, part of the Social Security (Overpayment and Recovery) Regulations 2013, came into force on 8th April 2013. Note that these regulations are only in force in England, Scotland and Wales and so excludes Northern Ireland (and Channel Islands and the Isle of Man).

## Prioritisation of Attachment Orders
When an employee has multiple Attachment Orders, the order in which they are processed is important. The prioritisation of these orders is typically as follows:

### Scottish Regulations

[The Diligence against Earnings (Variation) (Scotland) Regulations 2021](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2021/409/made) provides the rates and thresholds for Attachment Orders in Scotland.
